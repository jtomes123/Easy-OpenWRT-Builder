# üöÄ Custom OpenWRT Image Build & VM Conversion Script

### A simplfied approach to creating custom OpenWRT firmware images:
- Manage your own list(s) of OpenWRT packages
- Optionally resize default partitions to unlock extra filesystem storage
- Optionally convert OpenWRT images into into QEMU, Virtualbox, HyperV or VMware images
- Automated installation of all Linux dependencies required to build OpenWRT

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Script Option Prompts

1. Enter desired OpenWRT release version (hit enter for latest snapshot)
2. Modify partition sizes or keep OpenWRT defaults? [y/n] (Y = follow the prompts)
3. Enter an image filename tag (to uniquely identify your new image)
4. **Optional**: Convert OWRT images to VM disk? [y/n] (Y = select a VM format: qcow2, qed, vdi, vhdx or vmdk)
5. **Optional**: Permanently bake custom OpenWRT config files into the new OWRT image

6. When the script completes, new images are located at `$(pwd)/openwrt_build_output/firmware_images`, and corresponding VM images at `$(pwd)openwrt_build_output/vm`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Any recent x86 Debian-flavored OS with the sudo package installed. All other image building dependencies are automatically installed on first run.
Windows subsystem for Linux users see here: https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/toolchain/wsl

## üìñ Instructions


1. üì• Download the image builder script and make it executable:
   ```
   chmod +x x86-imagebuilder.sh
   ```

2. üõ†Ô∏è Customize your package recipie in the `CUSTOM_PACKAGES` section. The included list of packages are examples and can be edited. If you have issues building, check the build output for package conflicts.


3. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the script **without** sudo (it will prompt for sudo) and follow the prompts:
   ```
   ./x86-imagebuilder.sh
   ```
4. VMware ESXi users see [here](https://github.com/itiligent/Easy-OpenWRT-Builder/blob/main/OWRT-ON-ESXi.md) for extra required steps.

## üìÇ Persistent filesystem expansion WITHOUT resizing partitions

It is possible to add a third **persistent** EXT4 data partition that, unike resized partitions, won't be wiped by sysupgrade.

1. After image flash or vm launch, create a new EXT4 partition and add its new PART-UUID details into the /etc/fstab file.
2. Next, re-run the script, this time adding the new fstab file to `$(pwd)/openwrt_inject_files` when prompted.
3. Reflash your system with this new build. The fstab file containing the EXT4 partition details is now baked into the build and will be persistent even after a reset.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

- Parition resize should only be used with x86 builds. Resize of firmware paritions om router NAND flash brick your device!!
- Modified partition sizes are not compatible with attended-sysupgrade. Instead, create new images with your backup config and resize settings, then re-flash.
